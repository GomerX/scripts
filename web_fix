# This will recursively set permissions on directories only to 2775
# This sets the set GID bit so that any file created in these directories
# is editable by anyone in the group. Files will still be created
# with rw-r--r-- permissions, but since they have write permissions on the
# directory they can still overwrite any file.
#
# Usage: ./web_fix <directory>

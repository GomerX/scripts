scripts
=======

Utility scripts I have written. 

Just a collection of scripts I have found useful, mostly for Linux systems
administration.

None of them are amazing, but these are things that I got tired of doing by
hand so I made a script. 

There would actually be scripts here, but the Vineyard firewall that blocks git
traffic (over ssh and HTTPS).

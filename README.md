scripts
=======

Utility scripts I have written. 

Just a collection of scripts I have found useful, mostly for Linux Systems
Administration.

None of them are amazing, but these are things that I got tired of doing by
hand so I made a script. Perl scripts get their own directory. There is also BASH, Ruby and Python. Just depends on what made sense at the time.
